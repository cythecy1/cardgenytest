Summary Create management portal and Web API (referred as GLvNext API below) to serve retail offers for mobile and SPA clients.  Details Offers should be  created locally via admin portal by merchants and  additionally, sourced from various remote APIs all available for consumption via the new GLvNext API for mobile / SPA clients. Offer (served via API) must have fields Title Description Please introduce more fields you consider required for Offer to be useable.  Offer example:  Title: “Get 20% discount for purchases over $100 from selected merchants this Valentine day” Description: “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat” Considerations: Admin portal authentication/authorisation can be mocked and not required to be fully implemented at this stage or focused at; Initial focus should be on backend and Web API implementation rather than front-end and UI/UX; No user login required to use GLvNext API; Please show usage of HttpClient in the solution; The system should be able to handle high load especially on API side but also handle possible large datasets coming from external sources, consider that this might be a part of large system and integrating with multiple data providers;  Choice of frontend stack is not important (we usually do standard ASP.net Core MVC, jquery or vue.js rather than SPA type of web apps)  Backend stack preferably .NET Core, any version 2.1 to 3.1;  Use Azure stack if familiar; Data persistence / ORM, the choice is yours, preference would be MS SQL and EF Core; Remote API to Consume Remote Offers API details: https://2d976b39.azurewebsites.net/v1/offers https://2d976b39.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html Required headers Gl-ApiKey: 8B5A92FC-CA0F-4920-9358-50D2EE74A716 Gl-AppKey: FB Feel free to ask questions about this API during the test. To-Do  Provide the following Approximate estimate in hours/days; High level breakdown of tasks to do; Next, you are required to set up the solution and start implementation. You are not expected to complete this within given 2 hours, so this is not a speed/stress test, simply work in your normal pace, the way you would usually do on a project. Please, submit your work either by zipping the solution up and sharing (dropbox etc.) or via GitHub, GitLab, Azure devops etc. Any clarification and questions are most welcome either via skype or email. Skype: pavel.orlov000 Email: pavel@globalloyalty.com  Bonus Task A bit of refactoring, please spend 15 min to review and submit PR with a few initial changes you recommend here if any. If you think it needs to be refactored further, put your ideas in the description of the PR. https://github.com/jack0fshad0ws/Interview-Quiz/blob/master/GL.FileParser/Class1.cs
